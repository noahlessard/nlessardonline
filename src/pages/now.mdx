# What I am Doing Now

## January, 2026

This is a <Link href="https://sive.rs/now2">now page</Link>, and its purpose is to let you know what I'm up to in the current moment, and be updated more frequently than the rest of this website. I may add an archive at some point, but I think it being temporary might be more interesting.

This month, I am building this website, along the 2040Listener project. I've had the time to work on both these projects at the same time due to being on winter break and taking some time off work. It's fun to do PCB design and write C code.

Here is a picture of what I'm doing over the break, outside of projects:

<Image src={ramen} alt="Ramen" width={600} class="centered-image" />
