    >My name is Noah Lessard, welcome to my personal website. I'm studying Computer Engineering, as well as Computer Science at UW-Madison. I am interested in cybersecurity, automation, embedded systems and virtual reality. I run the <Link href="https://csec.cs.wisc.edu">Cybersecurity UW club</Link>, as well as a virtual reality studio called <Link href="https://odachivr.art">OdachiVR</Link>. I'm currently interning at <Link href="https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/">Oshkosh Corporation</Link> as a Cybersecurity Developer. When I'm not working with electronics, I like reading sci-fi, growing herbs or vegetables, playing old video games, and cooking noodles.
