# Projects

This page is a mix between a blog and a project list. The entries aren't exactly tutorials or resume materials, just my thoughts about the things I like to build or work on. It's here to perhaps help you learn something, find inspiration for navigating a project roadblock, or just learn more about me and what I like to work on.
