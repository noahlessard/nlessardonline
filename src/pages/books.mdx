# Reading List

I like to read when I want to deeply understand a new concept, find a solution to a personal or existential problem, or just jog my imagination and creativity. I've found some of my favorite books by looking at someone's reading list, so here's mine in the hope you may like some of them too.

<BookListing
    title="C Traps and Pitfalls, Andrew Koenig"
    description="This book teaches how the peculiarities of the C language make it easy for the intended behavior of a program and the actual behavior of a program to differ, follows up with examples and helpful advice on many of these 'pitfalls'. Each chapter includes exercises for contemplation with accompanying discussions at the end of the book."
    rating="I'm reading through and looking at this one all the time, I think it has something to teach everyone who uses C."

    title="The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect, Roger Williams"
    description="In a time not far from our own, Lawrence sets out simply to build an artificial intelligence that can pass as human, and finds himself instead with one that can pass as a god. Taking the Three Laws of Robotics literally, Prime Intellect makes every human immortal and provides instantly for every stated human desire. At turns shocking and humorous, Prime Intellect looks unflinchingly at extremes of human behavior that might emerge when all limits are removed."
    rating="This was a very creative take on an malicious artificial intelligence trope that is very popular in science fiction. Sometimes funny, horrific, or philosophical, this book made me think about how humans, and maybe life in general, would interact in a perfect system. Roger Williams also writes some other interesting sci fi stories, under the Mortal Passage trilogy, although I would recommend starting with this one."

    title="Coding Styles That Kill, Clifford E. Cummings"
    description="One of the most misunderstood constructs in the Verilog language is the nonblocking assignment. Even very experienced Verilog designers do not fully understand how nonblocking assignments are scheduled in an IEEE compliant Verilog simulator and do not understand when and why nonblocking assignments should be used. This paper details how Verilog blocking and nonblocking assignments are scheduled, gives important coding guidelines to infer correct synthesizable logic and details coding styles to avoid Verilog simulation race conditions."
    rating="Not really a book, but I was told to read this in my Digital System Design And Synthesis class and I'm so glad I did. It has great coverage of how Verilog events work and there are even no-brainer guidelines at the end. If you study the concepts in this paper, you will just write better Verilog, no question."

    title="Starfish, Peter Watts"
    description="A huge international corporation has developed a facility along the Juan de Fuca Ridge at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to exploit geothermal power. They send a bio-engineered crew--people who have been altered to withstand the pressure and breathe the seawater--down to live and work in this weird, fertile undersea darkness. Unfortunately the only people suitable for long-term employment in these experimental power stations are crazy, some of them in unpleasant ways. How many of them can survive, or will be allowed to survive, while worldwide disaster approaches from below?"
    rating="There is sci-fi with spaceships, megacorps, and laser guns, and then there is Peter Watts sci-fi, where the secret government running the world is merely trying to fight against the force of societal entropy itself, desperately trying to holding the world together from a dozen nightmarish, but wonderfully creative, apocalypses. The characters all find themselves at the furthest edge of what is physically possible, but never outside it. Peter Watts demonstrates his PhD in Zoology and Resource Ecology, and clearly puts mountains of research into all of his books to scare and captivate you in completely new ways."
