# Reading List

I like to read when I want to deeply understand a new concept, find a solution to a personal or existential problem, or just jog my imagination and creativity. I've found some of my favorite books by looking at someone's reading list, so here's mine in the hope you may like some of them too.

<BookListing
    title="C Traps and Pitfalls, Andrew Koenig"
    description="This book teaches how the peculiarities of the C language make it easy for the intended behavior of a program and the actual behavior of a program to differ, follows up with examples and helpful advice on many of these 'pitfalls'. Each chapter includes exercises for contemplation with accompanying discussions at the end of the book."
    rating="I'm still reading through this one and looking at it all the time, I think it has a lot of practical and worthwhile advice for people who like C."

    title="The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect, Roger Williams"
    description="In a time not far from our own, Lawrence sets out simply to build an artificial intelligence that can pass as human, and finds himself instead with one that can pass as a god. Taking the Three Laws of Robotics literally, Prime Intellect makes every human immortal and provides instantly for every stated human desire. At turns shocking and humorous, Prime Intellect looks unflinchingly at extremes of human behavior that might emerge when all limits are removed."
    rating="This was a very creative take on an malicious artificial intelligence trope, and made me think about how people would behave in a perfect world."

    title="Coding Styles That Kill, Clifford E. Cummings"
    description="One of the most misunderstood constructs in the Verilog language is the nonblocking assignment. Even very experienced Verilog designers do not fully understand how nonblocking assignments are scheduled in an IEEE compliant Verilog simulator and do not understand when and why nonblocking assignments should be used. This paper details how Verilog blocking and nonblocking assignments are scheduled, gives important coding guidelines to infer correct synthesizable logic and details coding styles to avoid Verilog simulation race conditions."
    rating="This has great coverage of how Verilog events work and there are even no-brainer guidelines at the end. If you study the concepts in this paper, you will just write better Verilog."

    title="Starfish, Peter Watts"
    description="A huge international corporation has developed a facility along the Juan de Fuca Ridge at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean to exploit geothermal power. They send a bio-engineered crew--people who have been altered to withstand the pressure and breathe the seawater--down to live and work in this weird, fertile undersea darkness. Unfortunately the only people suitable for long-term employment in these experimental power stations are crazy, some of them in unpleasant ways. How many of them can survive, or will be allowed to survive, while worldwide disaster approaches from below?"
    rating="This book takes place at the furthest edge of what is scientifically possible, but never too far outside it. Peter Watts demonstrates his PhD in Zoology and Resource Ecology, and does deep research for all of his books in order to captivate and scare in completely new ways."
